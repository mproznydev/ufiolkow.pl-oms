## About The Project :ice_cream:

![](https://github.com/mproznydev/ufiolkow.pl-oms/blob/master/src/assets/demo/demo.webp)

This application is mvp created for small company that is dealing with ice-cream manufacture.
<br/>
The idea was to simplify collecting orders from clients (b2b) and enable managing them.
Due to fact that it is mvp application, it has only version for admin, although site for clients will be prepared. </br>
